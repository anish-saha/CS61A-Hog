# CS61A-Hog
My first project for CS61A. A strategic dice game for two players with a few interesting twists! <br>
Rules: <br>
1) Roll 0-10 dice, you get the score of the sum of the faces of the dice, but if you roll a one on any of those dice,
you will add that number of dice to the opponent's score and you receive 0 points for that turn. Rolling 0 dice will 
add one greater than the highest digit of the opponents score to your own. <br>
2) If the sum of the two player's score is seven, special four-sided dice are used for the current turn. <br>
3) If two players have scores that are reverse of each other (ex: 07 and 70), then the players swap scores. <br>
4) If a player has a prime number score, that score is raised to the next prime number. <br>
5) First player to 100 points wins. Have fun! :)

To play, simply use the following command: `python3 hog.py`
